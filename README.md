# NumPy crash course

written by Mehdi Paydayesh, 27/04/2019


## Motivation

NumPy (stands for Numerical Python) is one of the most powerful and widely used Python libraries for Data Scientists and Machine Learning engineers. Understanding NumPy is the starting point of data processing and later implementing ML Algorithms. It provides high-performance multidimensional array objects (especially when compared with Python lists!), and functions for working with these arrays. The main application in data science is performing linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities
I have put together a Notebook in my GitHub repository that covers the basics of NumPy array manipulation to access data and subarrays, and to split, reshape and generate random numbers. While the types of operations may seem a bit dry, they comprise the building blocks of many other examples used in Python programming in Machine Learning. 
My Jupiter notebook contains a crash course of NumPy that provides the common NumPy operations in an easy-to-follow style. Hope you enjoy it!

## Requirements

The major libraries used in these projects are:
1. numpy


## File structure

The notebook file is called **NumpyCrashCourse.ipynb** and includes the following sections:

**Part 0: importing libararies**

**Part 1: bulitin functions in numpy**

**Part 2: max, min and mean operations**

**Part 3: reshaping**

**Part 4: indexing**

**Part 5: masking**
